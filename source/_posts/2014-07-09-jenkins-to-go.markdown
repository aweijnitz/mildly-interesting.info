I made [a Vagrant box with Jenkins on it](http://automation.better-than.tv/) for all you CI needs.

You might have seen the fabulous Boostrap theme [BOOTSTRA.386](https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386) by [kristopolus](https://github.com/kristopolous) recently. If you didn't, I recommend having a look. Be prepared to take a trip down Nostaligia Lane! 

Whenever I find a cool theme or an inspiring framework, I always wish I had a suitable project ready to apply it to, but I never have. In this case however, I decided to make a quick write-up of a Vagrant box I have been working on recently. It is a pre-packaged Jenkins box that is intended to work as a "CI server" to go.

In the back of my mind, I am thinking it might work nicely together with the [Gitlab box](http://localhost:4000/blog/2013/12/29/gitlab-in-a-box/) I made earlier this year. Ever since I uploaded it to the [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/aweijnitz/gitlab62svn), it has been getting som occational downloads.

Once more, [read about it here](http://automation.better-than.tv/).
